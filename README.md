# Sql-Challenge
Background 
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.


Data Engineering: 
In this first part of the Challenge I created a ERD Diagram which is important in showing relationships between data avriables and how these variables connect together in what will be an important part of our analysis later in the challenge. In this section of the challenge we also created the constraints which include foreign keys along with primary. 

Data Analysis: 
IN this last section of the challenge we take wthe relationships and constraints from our Data Engineering and use SQl Queries to perform an analysis using the data in csv files imported into our sql tables.
